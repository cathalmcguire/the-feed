    "main": "<p>Before opening the coolest cafe in Dublin, it's owners ran a falafel stall at festivals. After world trip spent gathering ideas for their next business venture, they returned to set up this trendy eatery on the fringe of the city centre.</p><p>A cafe with a consience - the Fumbally prides itself on working closely with suppliers to ensure food ingredients are as ethical as possible. The menu changes daily, although a few dishes remain constantly; scrambled eggs with Gubeen cheese, garlic and tomatoes is one of a few signatures.</p><p>Coffee is by 3FE, with guest roasters sometimes making an appearance. A double shot comes as standard and there's the option of organic whole milk or house-made sunflower milk. The cafe has a penchant for all things pickled and fermented - be sure to try one of their flavoured komuchas.</p><p>With mismatched antique furniture, affable staff and soulful music, Aisling Rogerson and Luca Dâ€™Alfonso have created a warm and welcoming cafe space from an unassuming celtic tiger era retail unit.</p><p>Next door, The Fumbally Stables offers workshops, talks and events centred around food. The building was built circa 1750 and was used by nearby brewers and distileries in the historic Blackpitts area.</p>",
