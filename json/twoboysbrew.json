    "blurb": "These two Drogheda boys are part of a wave of inspired, returned emigrants that are doing exciting things across Ireland. Taurean Coughlan and Kevin Roche, after brief stints in Joe's Coffee and Sister Sadie respectively, came up with a simple plan: take all of the best elements from their favourite cafes across the world, and combine them in one venue.",
    "main": "The first thing you'll notice is the minimalist, Danish-inspired, interiors by Terry Design, of Rathmine's Grove Rd and Belfast's Established fame. Previously a fried chicken joint, the space has been stripped back and given a slick sheen; the use of lighting is of particular note.<br/>The menu pays homeage to the owners' love of Melbourne and it's cafe scene. It offers light and healthy dishes such as Sweet Corn Fritters, and a Super Foods Salad; a good excuse to order a prosecco or mimosa. Weekends are all about brunch, but sandwiches and lunch items are available on weekdays. Again, food presentation is all about style. There's a retail section too, with international coffee blends and artisan chocolates.<br/>The coffee, (3FE and guests) is the best around for miles; even the batch brew - aka filter coffee - is worth a try. Cold press juices by Sprout & Co are available and tea is by Wall and Keogh. Professional service completes the package that has a mixed crowd, of all ages, queing for a table every weekend.<br/>",
